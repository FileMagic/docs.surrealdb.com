#  Settings and customisation

In the bottom left of the interface you can find a ⚙ button to open the settings dialog. These settings allow you to further customise the behaviour and appearance of Surrealist, such as switching between light and dark mode, increasing or decreasing the editor font sizes, and configure default values for new connections.

## Customising the interface

Surrealist offers a range of customisation options to tailor the interface to your liking. You can find these options in the settings dialog. 

## Behaviour

In this section you can configure the behaviour of the interface, such as toggling automatic connection on startup, auto complete suggetions and error validation in the editor. 

## Appearance

The appearance section allows you to scale the fonts in the editor and also select your default query output view and set the behaviour for your Query and designer views.


## Templates 

Templates allow you to set up different connection configurations that you can easily switch between. This is useful if you have multiple databases you frequently connect to, or if you have different configurations for different environments.
