import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage';
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';


#  Settings and customisation

In the bottom left of the interface you can find a ⚙ button to open the settings dialog. These settings allow you to further customise the behaviour and appearance of Surrealist, such as switching between light and dark mode, increasing or decreasing the editor font sizes, and configure default values for new connections.

## Behaviour

In this section you can configure the behaviour of the interface, such as connection and editor related settings.

## Appearance

The appearance section allows you to scale the fonts in the editor and also select your default query output view and set the behaviour for your Query and designer views.

## Templates

You can configure [connection templates](/docs/surrealist/advanced-topics/connection-templates) to reuse connection details when creating new connections. This is especially useful when you find yourself connecting to similar databases frequently.

## Database Serving

This section allows you to alter the behaviour of the database serving functionality found in Surrealist Desktop, such as altering the port and specifying the path to the database executable.
